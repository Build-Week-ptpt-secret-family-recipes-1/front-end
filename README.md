Proposal
What problem does your app solve?
Lets us store our family recipes
Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem? Lets users organize and keep a record of family history by having a central location that is easily accessed.
What is the mission statement?
Keeping future generations connected to their past one recipe at a time.
:bulb: Features
What features are required for your minimum viable product? We need to be able to create a new user, add a new recipe, and be able to sort the recipes by title or category. We also need to be able to add ingredients and instructions for each recipe.
What features may you wish to put in a future release? Add a picture of the original recipe.
Invite other users to view your recipes.
What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users? search recipes other uses have set to public Make ingredients into shopping lists Be able to rate the recipe by ease of use and flavor
:hammer_and_wrench: Frameworks - Libraries
What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using? react, redux, node, express, axios, styled components
Do the APIs you need require you to contact them to gain access? Yes
Are you required to pay to use said API(s)? No
:abacus: For Data Scientists
Describe the established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day one.
Write a description for what the data science problem is. What uncertainty or prediction are you trying to discover? How could this data be used to find a solution to this problem?
What kind of target output can you deliver to the Web/UX/iOS teams to work with? Is it in JSON format or something else?
:dart: Target Audience
Who is your target audience? Be specific. Any user who is interested their food past. Anyone who wants to share or learn new cooking.
What feedback have you gotten from potential users? I'd be interested in using this app. I love to cook, and I have some family recipes that I don't want to lose.
Have you validated this problem and your solution with a target audience? Describe how.
:key: Prototype Key Feature(s)
How long do you think it will take to implement these features? Less than 2 weeks.
Do you anticipate working on stretch functionality after completion of a Minimal Viable Product? Yes if time permits.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
